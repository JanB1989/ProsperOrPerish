Modification for the Game Europa Universalis 5

Economy and Population Growth.
This mod disentangles Population Growth from Prosperity, Development and other (imo) non sensical things, now making Food the primary driver of pop growths and migration.

The old factors, however now impact food capacity and growth.

It introduces a sharp difference between Rural Food Producers and Urban Food Consumers, incentivizes local manufacturing in province manufacturing to somewhat break capital-centric "clumping," and drastically increases the cost of infrastructure to make/maintain Roads a strategic investment rather than spamming them.

In general you will notice a lot of growth if food storages are full in smaller provinces and BIG emigration and death when they are not. Everything is centered around this idea.


Population Growth
Vanilla: Population growth is not swingy enough, is too low, too dependent on factors that have nothing to do with food
Solution: The main driver of pop growth is now the currently stored food in the province, many changes have been made to facilitate this. The higher (hover over province food) the amount of months of currently food stored in the province is the higher your pop growth will be.


Infrastructure
Vanilla: Everyone spams roads everywhere at all times, ROI of roads is way too fast. Advanced goods are WAY too abundant
Solution (best i could implement for now): Road cost and maintenance massively increased, if you don't have the resources in your market you can't build further roads. Sadly road maintenance ducats cost is currently paid by no one (bug?) and it just creates demand. City buildings have increased gold cost aswell to stop high quality goods from being abundant immediately after 20 years ingame.


Food
Vanilla: Food is never a problem, and can be ignored totally.
Solution: Food consumption is increased substantially across the board but especially for higher level pops. Rural locations are much better at producing food, especially if they are far below their pop cap (lore: peasants pick the best land spots first), still worth it to fill province with farmers to produce even more food.
Cities and Towns now receive growing food production mali based on number of staffed buildings build (idea is city grows, farmland reduces), in later game and with the right RGO they can overcome this, but in some cases and earlier in game it might not be worth it.

Depending on how heavy the winter is,pop food consumption in heavier winters is also increased (gotta bulk up).

Ingame you can check this by hovering over the province (food storage) it will tell you how much food (how many months) of food you are storing in that province, if that number is high your population with grow faster, if its low they will not.

Capital Clumping
Vanilla: It's always most sensible to clump 10 cities around your capital, because of control and market access
Solution (best i could implement for now): I buffed production efficiency of goods that use province-intern produced wares as inputs by a massive amount. This means it now might be worth it to connect a further away place and develop it to a city earlier, because you reap massive production efficiency rewards. Techs that buff this in vanilla are also buffed massively.


Food Storage
Vanilla: Totally irrelevant and bonus having it way too hard to use. No variance in food production.
Solution: Food storage is buffed across the board (also by development further), cities and towns have some innate storage. Sieged provinces keep their food storage, but if occupied they lose a lot. Your current food storage amount in province dictates your growth, if it gets destroyed or ignored, you are in trouble.
Since many factors change food production and thus your storage amount (including winters), heavy winters can punish you badly if you tried to not build up enough food storage.


Trade
Vanilla: It never is particularly good to export or import made goods that are of high complexity, because creating the product yourself benefits from severe multiplicative production efficiency boni.
Solution (best i could implement for now): I halved the required trade capacity for all goods that are finished products. This should incentivize trading them more.


Starvation
Vanilla:Starvation already hit in vanilla.
Solution: Now it hits even worse, but especially your higher pops will lose status, also the people in the starving province will leave to greener pastures very quickly.

AI Changes
Vanilla: The ai makes way too many locations to cities and urbanizes to high pops too quickyl without punishment
Solution/Problem: This Ai behaviour lead to the AI urbanizing good food locations and then starving themselves badly badly in the midterm, while also not prioritizing food shortages particularly much, because it didnt matter much in Vanilla.
All of this is changed. Ai saves more food spots, build less cities, is rightfully panicked if food starts to get in trouble. All of this leads to the ai having to use a much larger part of their remaining labor force to produce food once it starts urbanizing, feeding the burghers in the city.


Necessary Building Changes
Since rural locations are much more necessary now I changed Construction Centers and Granaries to be buildable there as well.
