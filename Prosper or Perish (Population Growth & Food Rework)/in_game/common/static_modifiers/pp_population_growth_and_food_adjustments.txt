# This file is mostly used to reduce existing population growth modifiers to 0
# Generally the idea is to disentangle pop growth from everything that has nothing to do with food growth (mostly)
# If you provide a lot of food in the province, growth is massively increased, if not provinces grow very little

# This modifier is population growth impact at 100 prosperity (linearly scaled down if lower)
