	"short_description":	"[h2]Economic and demographic overhaul focusing.[/h2]\nThis mod disentangles Population Growth from Prosperity, making Food the primary driver of pop growths and migration.\n\nIt introduces a sharp divide between Rural Producers and Urban Consumers, incentivizes local manufacturing in province manufacturing (Vertical Integration) to somewhat break capital-centric \"clumping,\" and drastically increases the cost of infrastructure to make Roads a strategic investment rather than a checklist item.\n\n\n[h3]Population Growth[/h3]\n[b]Vanilla:[/b] Population growth is not swingy enough, is too low, too dependent on factors that have nothing to do with food  \n[b]Solution:[/b] The main driver of pop growth is now the currently stored food in the province, many changes have been made to facilitate this.\n\n\n[h3]Infrastructure[/h3]\n[b]Vanilla:[/b] Everyone spams roads everywhere at all times, ROI of roads is way too fast  \n[b]Solution (partial):[/b] Road cost and maintenance massively increased, if you don't have the resources in your market you can't build further roads. Sadly road maintenance ducats cost is currently paid by no one (bug?) and it just creates demand. Also road cost scales with development of province. Development is already the best modifier in the game and I think it makes sense that a highly developed megacity pays a little more for their roads than a single road going through the countryside.\n\n\n[h3]Food[/h3]\n[b]Vanilla:[/b] Food is never a problem, and can be ignored totally.  \n[b]Solution:[/b] Food consumption is increased substantially across the board but especially for higher pops. Rural locations are much better at producing food, especially if they are far below their pop cap (lore: peasants pick the best land spots first), still worth it to fill province with farmers to produce even more food.  \nCities and towns have massive food production debuffs, in later game and with the right RGO they can overcome this, but in some cases and earlier in game it's not worth it.\n\n\n[h3]Capital Clumping[/h3]\n[b]Vanilla:[/b] It's always most sensible to clump 10 cities around your capital, because of control and market access  \n[b]Solution (partial/TBD):[/b] I buffed production efficiency of goods that use province-intern produced wares as inputs by 50%. This means it now might be worth it to connect a further away place and develop it to a city earlier, because you reap massive production efficiency rewards. Techs that buff this in vanilla are also buffed massively.\n\n\n[h3]Food Storage[/h3]\n[b]Vanilla:[/b] Totally irrelevant and bonus having it way too hard to use. No variance in food production.  \n[b]Solution:[/b] Food storage is buffed across the board (also by development further), cities and towns have some innate storage. Sieged provinces keep their food storage, but if occupied they lose a lot. Your current food storage amount in province dictates your growth, if it gets destroyed or ignored, you are in trouble.  \nSince many factors change food production and thus your storage amount (including winters), heavy winters can punish you badly if you tried to not build up enough food storage.\n\n\n[h3]Trade[/h3]\n[b]Vanilla:[/b] It never is particularly good to export or import made goods that are of high complexity, because creating the product yourself benefits from severe multiplicative production efficiency boni.  \n[b]Solution (partial/TBD):[/b] I halved the required trade capacity for all goods that are finished products. This should incentivize trading them more.\n\n\n[h3]Starvation[/h3]\n[b]Vanilla:[/b] Starvation already hit in vanilla.  \n[b]Solution:[/b] Now it hits even worse, but especially your higher pops will lose status, also the people in the starving province will leave to greener pastures very quickly.\n\n\n[h3]Necessary Building Changes[/h3]\nSince rural locations are much more necessary now I changed Construction Centers and Granaries to be buildable there as well.\n\nMany more changes (building levels, building cost etc.)\n\nHelp and Feedback is greatly appreciated and I have more changes in mind.\n\n[b]In my humble opinion this is the greatest paradox game of all time and I'm absolutely in love with it.[/b]\n\n[b]Ps:[/b] Does someone know how to scale road maintenance (and maybe other infr",
